I'll keep the first post nice and short. I decided to scrap the old site I started building in college and begin again.
I'm going with Jekyll to build it and it will be a gradual process over the next few weeks. The site will have a lot of placeholder stuff and may be broken at times. 
Once it is up and going I will get back to making games and other things.
